    <p>
      This Mexican chicken bake is a high-protein, low-calorie meal that leaves
      you full. It's so flavorful. Goes great with cornbread and/or a side of
      refried beans. You can use whatever Mexican spices you want. We love
      cumin!

    <h2>Mexican Chicken Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 ounces shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
      <li>1 cup salsa</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make Mexican Chicken</h2>
    <p></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium
        heat. Season one side of chicken breasts with 1/2 of the cumin, 1/2 of
        the garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; arrange chicken breasts
        seasoned-side down in hot oil. Fry until chicken is lightly browned on
        the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>Season the top of each chicken breast with
        remaining cumin, remaining garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; flip
        chicken and cook until other side is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. If
        the skillet gets dry, pour in just enough salsa juice to keep it from
        burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>Transfer chicken breasts to a 9-inch square
        baking dish; sprinkle with Mexican cheese blend. Loosen drippings from
        the skillet with a little more salsa juice and pour on top of chicken
        breasts. Spoon salsa over cheese layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>Bake chicken breasts until no longer pink in the
        center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
